QuakeQuestSwitcher is a very simple bare bones Android app with only one job: to let me switch between different Quake mods in [Dr. Beef's QuakeQuest for the Oculus Quest](https://github.com/DrBeef/QuakeQuest) without needing a PC (after initial setup) and without even needing to take the VR headset off.

Command line options for QuakeQuest are controlled in `/QuakeQuest/commandline.txt`. QuakeQuestSwitcher goes looking in the `/QuakeQuest/commandline/` folder for any files ending with `.txt` to display a menu. You click on which file you want, and QuakeQuestSwitcher will replace `commandline.txt` with that file. The next time you start QuakeQuest, it will load with the command line options in that file, enabling you to play other Quake engine games!

Of course you need to put the games on the internal storage in your Quest yourself. But here are a list of games I have got working!

* QUAKE Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon
* QUAKE Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity
* QUAKE Mission Pack 3: Abyss of Pandemonium
